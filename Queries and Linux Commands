SQL Query

fetch all department names along with the number of employess in that department (consider even the unstaffed) and then the result should be sorted in descending of the number of employees and if two departments have same count then sort by department name


SELECT 
    Department.name, 
    COUNT(Employee.id)
FROM 
    Department
LEFT JOIN 
    Employee ON Department.dept_id = Employee.dept_id
GROUP BY 
    Department.dept_id, 
    Department.name
ORDER BY 
    COUNT(Employee.id) DESC, 
    Department.name




Table Person(id, first_name, last_name)


I want you to fetch the count of all duplicate records that have same first_name and last_name

Table
1, ABC, XYZ
2, ABC, XYZ
4, ABC, XYZ
5, TYP, FHG
6, TYP, FHG
3, CDF, FHG

Output
ABC, XYZ, 3

select first_name, last_name , count(*) from Person
group by first_name , last_name
having (count(*) >1 );
